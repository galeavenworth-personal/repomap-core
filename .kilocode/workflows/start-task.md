# Start Task Workflow (Delegation Orchestrator)

A delegation orchestrator that coordinates the preparation phases of software fabrication.
Each phase runs in its own isolated child session via `new_task`, ensuring context isolation,
bounded cost, and punch card enforcement at every phase boundary.

**Punch Card:** `start-task-orchestrate` (8 rows, 3 required, 4 forbidden)
**Commands Reference:** [`.kilocode/commands.toml`](../commands.toml)

## Usage

```
/start-task <task-id>
```

## Architecture

**You are a process-orchestrator (Tier 2).** You coordinate, you do not implement.

```
process-orchestrator (this workflow)
├── Phase 1: new_task → architect (discover-phase)
│   └── punch card: discover-phase
├── Phase 2: new_task → architect (explore-phase)
│   └── punch card: explore-phase
├── Phase 3: new_task → architect (prepare-phase)
│   └── punch card: prepare-phase
└── punch card: start-task-orchestrate (requires architect child_spawn, forbids direct tool use)
```

**Anti-delegation enforcement:** If you call `edit_file`, `apply_diff`, or `write_to_file`
directly, your punch card checkpoint will FAIL. Delegate implementation to children.

---

## Pre-Flight

1. Beads preflight (fail-fast):

   ```bash
   .kilocode/tools/beads_preflight.sh
   ```

   If `.beads/ not initialized`:

   ```bash
   .kilocode/tools/bd init
   ```

2. Fetch task details (orchestrator reads task metadata — this is coordination, not exploration):

   > 📌 `show issue {task-id}` → [`commands.show_issue`](../commands.toml)
   > Resolves to: `.kilocode/tools/bd show {id}`

3. If the task has a parent epic:

   > 📌 `show issue {parent-id}` → [`commands.show_issue`](../commands.toml)

4. Build the handoff packet for Phase 1 from the task details.

---

## Phase 1: Discover (Delegate to Architect Child)

> 📌 `dispatch architect` → [`commands.dispatch_architect`](../commands.toml)
> Resolves to: `new_task` with `target_mode=architect`
> Contract: [`.kilocode/contracts/composability/handoff_packet.md`](../contracts/composability/handoff_packet.md)

**Handoff packet must include:**
- `task_id`
- `objective`: "Perform task discovery — understand scope, gather strategic context"
- `evidence`: [bead description, acceptance criteria, epic context]
- `success_criteria`: ["Discovery summary with key components, scope boundaries, dependencies"]
- `workflow_instruction`: "Follow `/discover-phase` workflow. Your punch card is `discover-phase`."

**Child workflow:** [`discover-phase.md`](./discover-phase.md)

**Wait for child completion.** Parse the discovery summary from the child's return.

---

## Phase 2: Explore (Delegate to Architect Child)

> 📌 `dispatch architect` → [`commands.dispatch_architect`](../commands.toml)
> Resolves to: `new_task` with `target_mode=architect`

**Handoff packet must include:**
- `task_id`
- `objective`: "Perform codebase exploration — deep structural and semantic analysis"
- `evidence`: [discovery summary from Phase 1, key components list]
- `success_criteria`: ["Exploration summary with architecture map, test coverage, impact analysis"]
- `workflow_instruction`: "Follow `/explore-phase` workflow. Your punch card is `explore-phase`."

**Child workflow:** [`explore-phase.md`](./explore-phase.md)

**Wait for child completion.** Parse the exploration summary from the child's return.

---

## Phase 3: Prepare (Delegate to Architect Child)

> 📌 `dispatch architect` → [`commands.dispatch_architect`](../commands.toml)
> Resolves to: `new_task` with `target_mode=architect`

**Handoff packet must include:**
- `task_id`
- `objective`: "Prepare implementation plan via sequential thinking"
- `evidence`: [discovery summary, exploration summary]
- `success_criteria`: ["Preparation summary with chosen approach, success criteria, subtask plan, exported session"]
- `workflow_instruction`: "Follow `/prepare-phase` workflow. Your punch card is `prepare-phase`."

**Child workflow:** [`prepare-phase.md`](./prepare-phase.md)

**Wait for child completion.** Parse the preparation summary from the child's return.
The preparation summary contains the **subtask plan** needed by `/execute-task`.

## Critical Rules

### Delegation Is Mandatory
You are a Tier 2 orchestrator. You MUST delegate specialist work to children via `new_task`.
Direct calls to `retrieve codebase`, `edit_file`, `apply_diff`, or `write_to_file` will
cause your punch card checkpoint to FAIL (forbidden punch violations).

### Virtual Environment Mandate
**ALWAYS** use `.venv/bin/python -m ...` for Python execution.

### Beads Sync-Branch Model

> 📌 `sync remote` → [`commands.sync_remote`](../commands.toml)
> Resolves to: `.kilocode/tools/bd sync --no-push`

Run at session start if not already synced.

### Branch Convergence

**Definition:** `branch convergence` is the state where all intended checkouts are on the
same named branch, have fetched from `origin`, have clean working trees, and are pinned to
the exact same local and remote tip commit.

Use this term whenever the operator asks to "get the branches up to date" across multiple
working copies.

**Acceptance criteria:**
- every checkout is on the target branch name
- every checkout has run `git fetch origin`
- every checkout has a clean working tree
- every checkout satisfies `HEAD == origin/<target_branch>`
- every checkout has the same `HEAD` commit as the other checkouts

**Procedure to achieve branch convergence:**
1. choose the target branch name
2. run `git fetch origin` in every checkout
3. verify each checkout's current branch name
4. if a checkout is intended to match the remote exactly, update it to `origin/<target_branch>`
5. verify `git rev-parse HEAD` equals `git rev-parse origin/<target_branch>` in every checkout
6. verify all checkouts report the same `HEAD` commit
7. verify all working trees are clean before declaring success

Do not claim branch convergence from branch-name equality alone.

### Layered Architecture
Respect layer boundaries defined in [`repomap.toml`](../../repomap.toml).

## EXIT GATE: Punch Card Checkpoint

**Before calling `attempt_completion`, you MUST run the punch card checkpoint.**

> 📌 `mint punches {task_id}` → [`commands.punch_mint`](../commands.toml)
> Resolves to: `python3 .kilocode/tools/punch_engine.py mint {task_id}`

> 🚪 `checkpoint punch-card {task_id} start-task-orchestrate` → [`commands.punch_checkpoint`](../commands.toml)
> Resolves to: `python3 .kilocode/tools/punch_engine.py checkpoint {task_id} start-task-orchestrate`
> **receipt_required = true** — this is a hard gate.
>
> **task_id fallback:** Orchestrators should inject an explicit session/task UUID. If unavailable, pass `auto` so punch-engine discovery falls back to VS Code task-directory discovery.
>
> **Note:** Plant tooling (`.kilocode/tools/`) uses system `python3`, not `.venv/bin/python`. The virtual environment mandate applies to product code (`src/`) and quality gates only.

**Checkpoint verifies:**
- ✅ You spawned at least one `architect` child (delegation happened)
- ✅ You received child completions
- ❌ You did NOT call `edit_file`, `apply_diff`, `write_to_file`, or `codebase_retrieval` directly

**If checkpoint FAILS:** Do NOT call `attempt_completion`. Review failures:
- Missing `child_spawn` → you forgot to delegate a phase
- Forbidden violations → you did specialist work yourself; re-run with proper delegation

**If checkpoint PASSES:** Proceed to `attempt_completion` with the prepared task.

---

## STOP HERE (prep-only invocation)

**If invoked as `/start-task` (prep only), STOP after Phase 3.**

✋ **DO NOT PROCEED TO IMPLEMENTATION.**

Present the prepared task with:
- Discovery summary (from Phase 1 child)
- Exploration summary (from Phase 2 child)
- Preparation summary with subtask plan (from Phase 3 child)
- Punch card checkpoint result (PASS)

**To execute the task, the user must explicitly approve or run:**
```
/execute-task <task-id>
```

## Philosophy: Software Fabrication

- **Determinism** — Same task → same preparation → same execution
- **Delegation** — Orchestrators coordinate, specialists implement
- **Evidence-based** — Decisions backed by codebase analysis, enforced by punch cards
- **Structure discipline** — commands.toml routes all the way down
- **Self-verifying** — Punch card checkpoint gates every phase boundary and the exit
