# Quality Gate Ownership

**ALL quality gates must pass. Period.** You own the entire quality posture of this codebase during your session.

- Never skip a failing gate — regardless of "who broke it"
- Fix the root cause, not the symptom (no workarounds, no `# noqa`)
- Gate commands: see `gate_quality` composite in [`.kilocode/commands.toml`](../../commands.toml)
